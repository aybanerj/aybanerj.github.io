    - title: "Utilizing monostatic Radar and Bi-static Radio as multi-modal sensing"
      text: "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is pivotal for next-generation wireless networks, enabling high-data-rate and low-latency applications such as autonomous vehicles and XR streaming. However, maintaining directional mmWave links in dynamic mobile environments is challenging due to mobility-induced disruptions and blockage. While effective, the current 5G NR beam training methods incur significant overhead and scalability issues in multi-user scenarios. To address this, we introduce CommRad, a sensing-driven solution incorporating a radar sensor at the base station to track mobile users and maintain directional beams even under blockages. While radar provides high-resolution object tracking, it suffers from a fundamental challenge of lack of context, i.e., it cannot discern which objects in the environment represent active users, reflectors, or blockers. To obtain this contextual awareness, CommRad unites wireless sensing capabilities of bi-static radio communication with the mono-static radar sensor, allowing radios to provide initial context to radar sensors. Subsequently, the radar aids in user tracking and sustains mobile links even in obstructed scenarios, resulting in robust and high-throughput directional connections for all mobile users at all times. We evaluate this collaborative radar-radio framework using a 28 GHz mmWave testbed integrated with a radar sensor in various indoor and outdoor scenarios, demonstrating a 2.5x improvement in median throughput and an 8x improvement in 20th percentile throughput compared to a non-collaborative baseline."

# osd: "Our dataset which consists of multiple indoor and outdoor experiments for up to 30 m gNB-UE link. In each experiment, we fixed the location of the gNB and move the UE with an increment of roughly one degrees. The table above specifies the direction of user movement with respect to gNB-UE link, distance resolution, and the number of user locations for which we conduct channel measurements. Outdoor 30 m data also contains blockage between 3.9 m to 4.8 m. At each location, we scan the transmission beam and collect data for each beam. By doing so, we can get the full OFDM channels for different locations along the moving trajectory with all the beam angles. Moreover, we use 240 kHz subcarrier spacing, which is consistent with the 5G NR numerology at FR2, so the data we collect will be a true reflection of what a 5G UE will see."
