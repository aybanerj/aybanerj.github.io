    - title: Abstract
      text: This work develops BSMA, a scalable LoRa MAC protocol that uses full duplex gateways to improve network capacity by 100% compared to CSMA in bursty loads. Implementing BSMA requires a full duplex LoRa gateway, which we develop in the 915 MHz ISM band. The implementation of a LoRa BSMA gateway is open source, and works with COTS LoRA devices.
osd: "The MATLAB simulator allows simulation of LoRa networks with various MAC protocols. The physical layer is abstracted out and the simulator can be used to evaluate the performance of MAC protocols in different network topologies. The LoRa testbed is also open source."
