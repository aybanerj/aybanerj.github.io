description:
    - text: "Connectivity on-the-go has been one of the most impressive technological achievements in the 2010s decade. However, multiple studies show that this has come at an expense of increased carbon footprint, that also rivals the entire aviation sector’s carbon footprint. The two major contributors of this increased footprint are (a) smartphone batteries which affect the embodied footprint and (b) base-stations that occupy ever-increasing energy footprint to provide the last mile wireless connectivity to smartphones. The root-cause of both these turn out to be the same, which is communicating over the last-mile lossy wireless medium. We show in this paper, titled DensQuer, how base-station densification, which is to replace a single larger base-station with multiple smaller ones, reduces the effect of the last-mile wireless, and in effect conquers both these adverse sources of increased carbon footprint. Backed by a open-source ray-tracing computation framework (Sionna), we show how a strategic densification strategy can minimize the number of required smaller base-stations to practically achievable numbers, which lead to about 3x power-savings in the base-station network. Also, DensQuer is able to also reduce the required deployment height of base-stations to as low as 15m, that makes the smaller cells easily deployable on trees/street poles instead of requiring a dedicated tower. Further, by utilizing newly introduced hardware power rails in Google Pixel 7a and above phones, we also show that this strategic densified network leads to reduction in mobile transmit power by 10-15 dB, leading to about 3x reduction in total cellular power consumption, and about 50% increase in smartphone battery life when it communicates data via the cellular network."
