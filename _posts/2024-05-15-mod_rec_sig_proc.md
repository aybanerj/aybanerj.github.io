      text: "Waveform Characterization is crucial for various
spectrum sensing applications such as anomaly detection and
measuring spectrum utilization. It consists of detecting the
waveform type (single carrier or spread spectrum), modulation form (QAM, PSK, FSK, GMSK, GFSK etc ̇) and corresponding parameters such as symbol rate and chip rate. In this paper, we propose a blind characterization algorithm suited for these applications using second-order cyclostationary and
fourier domain features of signals. To test the proposed method’s
robustness, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted using both
simulated and over-the-air (OTA) experiments with appropriate
signal detection pre-processing steps. An overall modulation
classification accuracy of 86.25% is attained for OTA testing
with a modulation set consisting of QAM, PSK, FSK, GFSK,
MSK, GMSK, DSSS and OOK."
