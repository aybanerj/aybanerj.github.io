### Wireless Sensing
We create cutting-edge sensing solutions to enhance the capabilities of robots and autonomous devices, including flexible robots and privacy-preserving localization techniques. We are pioneering next-generation localization systems for Industrial IoT 4.0, enabling safer and more efficient smart manufacturing, warehouse management, and private 5G networks. We have developed autonomous robots and deep-learning powered localization systems that enable easy-to-deploy location services, even in complex environments.

### Towards xG
We are overcoming the limitations of traditional mmWave connectivity to enable reliable, high-throughput communication for indoor and outdoor scenarios. We create new Massive MIMO architecture that is sustainable. We develop real-time RAN Intelligent Controller and AI algorithms for network optimization.



### Communication and Power Delivery for IoT Devices
We are developing ultra-low power WiFi communication and wireless power transfer technologies to dramatically improve the energy efficiency and connectivity of IoT devices. We build a low-power, long-range, and reliable backscatter systems. We improve the range of WiFi with smart surface deployment. We developed a universal sensing platform using wireless, batteryless RFID and flexible sensors.

### Spectrum Sensing
Sweep-Sensing 5 GHz in a milli-second: Sensing the entire spectrum with high-resolution and dynamic range in time, frequency, and space (wide-area) in cost efficiency is a need of the day and near-impossible. Such sensing would enable highly efficient communication, securing our communications and preserving our privacy.
Shipping the sensed spectrum data: Accurate spectrum sensing with just a single sensor generates 800 Mbps, which cannot be shipped in real-time. Enabling >1000x compression and shipping only necessary information.

### Autonomous Vehicles
We developed perception in bad-weather using Radar-based sensors and Enabled Cameras to perceive the depth in a sensor fusion approach.

### Security and Privacy
We expose the vulnerability of RF communication and sensing systems (e.g., spoofing automotive radars, jamming communication radios ) and prepare appropriate counter-measures to protect communication and sensing systems.

<!-- #### Our Approach
We embrace a holistic approach to research, combining fundamental theoretical exploration with practical implementation. We design and build prototypes to test and refine our concepts, ensuring our solutions are not only innovative but also practical and deployable in the real world. -->
