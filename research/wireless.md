Our work in wireless sensing is primarily geared towards improving state of the art in wireless localization for UWB, BLE and WiFi equipped devices, and considering the security and privacy implications of techonology we develop. Along these lines, we have developed mulitple open source hardware systems using off-the-shelf BLE, WiFi and UWB chipsets and devices to test novel localization algorithms, probe security concerns in these systems, and develop better defenses to preserve a wireless user's privacy.
