Our research towards securing the wireless infrastructure for both communications and sensing. We demonstrated several types of attacks such as Spoofing, Jamming, Obsfurcation, and provacy-preserving localization system. We developed algorithm to detect hidden IoT devices even when they are not connected to any wireless network, by detecting their unique Emanation signatures, protect against BLE location attack, and spoofing automototive radars.
