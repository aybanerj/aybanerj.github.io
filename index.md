<h3> Join Our Team! </h3>
We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!
<h4> Applications for PhD and Postdoc Positions </h4>
Send an email with the subject "Application PhD" or "Application Postdoc" directly to <i>dineshb [at] ucsd.edu</i> with your CV and a brief statement of why you are interested.
<h4> UCSD students </h4>
We routinely work with graduate and undergraduate students on all our projects. Contact Dinesh (or any other group member) via email or stop by the office to express your interest.
<h4> Students from Elsewhere </h4>
Sometimes, we work with students on summer internships if we get exceptional applicants. This usually means good academic standing and a personal recommendation.
